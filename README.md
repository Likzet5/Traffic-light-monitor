This was a school project, and this is part of the project files used.

The intention was to use sound to detect the beeps from a crosswalk signal. By identifying the specific frequency (Hz) of the beeps, it is possible to isolate them from other sounds around the area. Using a simple microphone placed in close proximity is sufficient.

By doing this, we can monitor the green and red lights without tampering with the traffic lights.
